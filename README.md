# Equal-Ecommerce


This is an e-commerce website with a shopping cart facility. It's made with the MERN stack. For the front-end, I have only used the React library and Express for the back-end ( express ***sucks*** without typescriptðŸŒš). I was able to finish the project but fail to make it online.
